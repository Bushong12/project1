cse30341 project 1: system calls and error checking (1/27/2017)

Project Description:
This project is a warm up assignment for the course. The basic concept is very simple: to write a program that copies a file from one place to another. However, the main challenge of engineering operating systems is dealing with errors and unexpected conditions. Thus, the main focus of this assignment will be on the correct handling of errors. 
You will write a program called copyit which simply copies a file from one place to another. copyit must create an exact copy of SourceFile under the new name TargetFile. Upon successful completion, copyit should report the total number of bytes copied and exit with result zero.If the copy takes longer than one second, then every second the program will emit a short message. If copyit encounters eny kind of error or user mistake, it must immediately stop and emit a message that states the program name, the failing operation, and the reason for the failure, and then exit with result 1. If the program is invoked incorrectly, then it should immediately exit with a helpful message. In short, there should be no possible way to invoke the program that results in a segmentation fault, a cryptic message, or a silent failure. Either the program runs successfully to completion, or it emits a helpful and detailed error message to the user.
